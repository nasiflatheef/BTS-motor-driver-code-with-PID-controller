# BTS-motor-driver-code-with-PID-controller
This code is designed to control the position of a motor using a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller. The motor's position is monitored using an encoder, and the PID controller adjusts the motor's movement to reach a target position. The code is written for an Arduino microcontroller and read the encoder position in real-time.
